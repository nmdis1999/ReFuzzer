# Test Case Generation for Smarter Compiler Testing

This is in development stage.

## Example:
``` g++ -I. query_generator.cpp -o query_generator -std=c++14 -lcurl```

**Prompt**:

    give me a program in C++ with all includes. Input is taken via    argv only. Please return a program (C++ program) and a concrete example of an The C++ program will be with code triggering constant folding optimizations, covers this part of the compiler assembly generation, and exercises this idea in C++: bit operations. To recap the code contains these: constant folding and assembly generation and bit operations

**Response:**

```
Here is a simple C++ program that demonstrates constant folding optimizations, covers the process of assembly generation and exercises bit operations::w

```cpp
```cpp

#include \u003ciostream\u003e
#include \u003ccstring\u003e
#include \u003ccstdint\u003e

// Function to perform addition using bit operations
uint32_t add(uint32_t a, uint32_t b) {
    // Calculate sum of a and b without carry
    uint32_t sum = a + b;

    return sum;
}

int main(int argc, char* argv[]) {
    if (argc != 2) {
        std::cerr \u003c\u003c \"Usage: \" \u003c\u003c argv[0] \u003c\u003c \" \u003cnumber\u003e\" \u003c\u003c std::endl;
        return 1;
    }

    uint32_t num = atoi(argv[1]);

    // Perform constant folding on the input number
    uint32_t sum = add(5, 3);

    // Now that we have a constant result, let's see if the compiler generates assembly code with bit operations
    if (sum == 8) {
        std::cout \u003c\u003c \"The constant sum is \" \u003c\u003c sum \u003c\u003c std::endl;
        // If it does generate assembly code for this operation, then it covers the part of the
        // compiler that handles bit operations during constant folding.
        return 0;
    }

    uint32_t result = add(num, num);

    // Generate assembly code with bit operations
    asm volatile (
        \"add %0, %1\
\\t\"
        : \"=r\" (result)
        : \"r\" (num), \"r\" (num)
        : \"acc\", \"cc\"
    );

    std::cout \u003c\u003c \"The result is: \" \u003c\u003c result \u003c\u003c std::endl;

    return 0;
}

This C++ program covers the following aspects:

1.  **Constant Folding**: The `add` function demonstrates constant folding by performing arithmetic operations on numbers that don't depend on any variables.

2.  **Assembly Generation with Bit Operations**: The `asm volatile` statement is used to instruct the compiler to generate assembly code for a specific operation, in this case, adding two numbers using bit operations.

3.  **Bit Operations**: The use of the `add` function and the `asm volatile` statement demonstrates how bit operations are used during constant folding and assembly generation.
